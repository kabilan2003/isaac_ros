# Interface Nvidia Jetbot with YOLO Object Detection in Omniverse Isaac ROS

jetbot with yolo object detection 

# Introduction

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to interface the Nvidia Jetbot with YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection in Omniverse Isaac ROS. The combination of Jetbot, a small AI-powered robot, and YOLO, a real-time object detection system, enables the robot to detect and recognize objects in its environment.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following components set up:

1. Nvidia Jetbot: Ensure that your Nvidia Jetbot is assembled and functioning correctly. You can find assembly instructions in the official Nvidia Jetbot documentation.
2. Omniverse Isaac ROS: Install and configure Omniverse Isaac ROS on your development machine. Refer to the Omniverse Isaac ROS documentation for detailed instructions.
3. YOLO Object Detection: Set up the YOLO object detection system on your Nvidia Jetbot. You can use a pre-trained YOLO model or train your own on a suitable dataset.

# Tutorial Steps
Follow these steps to interface the Nvidia Jetbot with YOLO object detection:

1. YOLO Integration: Integrate YOLO object detection into the Omniverse Isaac ROS environment. This step involves setting up YOLO's ROS nodes and configuring them to work with the Jetbot's camera feed.
2. Object Detection: Implement object detection algorithms in the Isaac ROS environment, utilizing YOLO's real-time capabilities to detect objects in the Jetbot's surroundings.
3. Visualization: Visualize the detected objects on the Jetbot's live camera feed, allowing you to see real-time object recognition in action.
4. Control Logic: Implement control logic to make the Jetbot respond to the detected objects. For example, the robot can avoid obstacles or follow specific objects based on their classes.
